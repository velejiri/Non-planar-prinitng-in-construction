# Non-planar-prinitng-in-construction
## Intro
While the CAD model is being prepared for 3D printing, it is sliced into layers. Contrary to planar slicing, where an object is cut by horizontal planes and then a curve for the toolpath is generated from these intersections, non-planar slicing uses twisted planes for object cutting. It brings freedom to toolpath creation and each object can be printed in adjusted layers that reflect its geometry. Benefits of such printing are being explored in plastics and involve enhanced surface finish, cracking reduction and ability to print cantilevers. This projects goal is to test advantages of non-planar prinitng using clay and concrete. This work was supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Technical University in Prague, grant No. SGS 161 - 1612309E000.
## Findings
Current research is focused on improving buildabuility of overhangs. Most experiments is done using clay prinitng. Results are presented in these papers:
